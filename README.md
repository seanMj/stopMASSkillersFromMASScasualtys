# stopMASSkillersFromMASScasualtys
Basically ideas to stop [severely reduce] mass shooters casualties rate. 

[Hallways] ok, I tried Hallways your up next.
Basically the first idea is to redesign the hallways to allowing running
from the site while keeping the person out of a killbox as often as possible.
High casualties can be reduced simply by implementing a solution like this. 

In another way: by using a snaking hallways, you can in theory keep a dynamic
and moving killbox, while also keeping dynamic and moving save zones. By using
Some principles of fluid dynamics and geometry we could reduce a large volume of 
Potential casualties from happening. The images explain better.   

Each time the shooter would have to readjust their stance/aim/firing pattern/etc.  
Giving people more time to escape without being injured. Might be a bit dumb but
I wanted to start somewhere after many hours on this problem sectioning it over
And over.
