# stopMASSkillersFromMASScasualtys
Basically ideas to stop [severely reduce] mass shooters casualtie rate. 

       [Hallways] ok, I tried Hallways your up next.

Basically the first idea is to redesign the hallways to allowing running
from the site while keeping the person out of a killbox as often as possible.
High casualties can be reduced simply by implementing a solution like this. 

In another way: by using a snaking hallways, you can in theory keep a dynamic
and moving killbox, while also keeping dynamic and moving save zones. By using
Some principles of fluid dynamics and geometry we could reduce a large volume of 
Potential casualties from happening. The images explain better.   

Each time the shooter would have to readjust their stance/aim/firing pattern/etc.  
Giving people more time to escape without being injured. Might be a bit dumb but
I wanted to start somewhere after many hours on this problem sectioning it over
And over.

DONT READ THIS, I've been working on this for 2wks now and got this far only. Just frustrated. 
Nvm its too dark...
But adding this to supermarkets as a testing ground would be a first step.
I mean if anyone wants to brainstorm this, no one is going to be stopping you from solving mass murderers
