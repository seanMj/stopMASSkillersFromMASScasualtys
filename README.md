# stopMASSkillersFromMASScasualtys
Honestly, no one should read until I can really form the thoughts for this idea. My thoughts and ideas are in images,  and I have to interpret :( 
Basically ideas to stop [severely reduce] mass shooters casualtie rate. 

       [Hallways] ok, I tried Hallways your up next.
                  [Try reading as if your really happy, like your absolutely happy with life at that moment. 
                  Like I was when I thought of this. It will make it less grim, add some nonchalantly attitude and it may read better. ]
#(i suck at writing painful things so I tried to write it... like nonchalantly)
Using snaking hallways, you can in theory keep dynamic
and moving killbox(s) which will make it harder on the mass murderer(s) to... well do murderer things, while also keeping dynamic, 
and moving save zones for victims. Just By using Some principles of fluid dynamics (idk where I seen it, but it was in my head 
just enough to make the connection) and a bit of geometry, we could reduce a large volume of  Potential casualties from happening 
just by dealing with issues of movement of people within static system... The images might explain better.   

Additionally, Each time the shooter has to readjust their stance/aim/firing pattern/etc.
As a shooter progresses through each kill box (i know grim, but saving lives is the goal and this is just a start) 
Giving people more time to escape without being injured. Might be a bit dumb but

I wanted to start somewhere after many hours on this problem sectioning it over from every perspective ðŸ˜“ðŸ¤®ðŸ¤§ðŸ‘¹
And while walking through the hallways of many types and places, seemed that At any given time and any given position,
there will always be safety spots from bullets Within any given snaked hallway, (or just at the front or the back)
instead of a straight on static rectangular kill box, which now I look at a bit different. as this shouldn't even be a problem to begin with...
I'm just thinking its possible to stop/reduce/prevent this issue even a little it would be a win.

Also adding lights along a hallway that direct away from gunshots so its not mass confusion, with a side of mass murderer. 
Or adding the snaking just at the front and the back of the hallways. 
This seems stupid... why not gigantic magnetic strips or whatever, i know.. 
but its a good start towards something better (and this is mainly for me to solve not for really any other reason) 

Like, not the whole hallway but at the front and the back,
 so someone can't just immediately know how how many people are in a given area..
I know there is a better way, one with ease. But I only got this right now. 

I wish people could just see what I see, it all makes sense up there but not on any other Medium.
