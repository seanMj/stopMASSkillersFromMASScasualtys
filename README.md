# stopMASSkillersFromMASScasualtys
Basically ideas to stop [severely reduce] mass shooters casualtie rate. 

       [Hallways] ok, I tried Hallways your up next.
       Its can reduce the deaths but... I don't know the math in this area so... idk where to begin. 
Basically the first idea is to redesign the hallways to allowing running
from the danger site while keeping the person(s) out of a static killbox as often as possible.
High casualties can be reduced in theory simply by implementing a strategy like this. 

In another way to say it: by using snaking hallways, you can in theory keep dynamic
and moving killbox(s), while also keeping dynamic, and moving save zones for victims. Just By using
Some principles of fluid dynamics (idk where I seen it, but it was in my head just enough to make the connection)
and a bit of geometry, we could reduce a large volume of  Potential casualties from happening just by dealing with 
issues of movement of people within static system... The images might explain better.   

Additionally, Each time the shooter has to readjust their stance/aim/firing pattern/etc.
As a shooter progresses through each kill box (i know grim, but saving lives is the goal and this is just a start) 
Giving people more time to escape without being injured. Might be a bit dumb but

I wanted to start somewhere after many hours on this problem sectioning it over from every perspective ðŸ˜“ðŸ¤®ðŸ¤§ðŸ‘¹
And while walking through the hallways of many types and places, seemed that At any given time and any given position,
there will always be safety spots from bullets Within any given snaked hallway, instead of a straight on static
rectangular kill box, which now I look at a bit different. as this shouldn't even be a problem to begin with...
I'm just thinking its possible to stop/reduce/prevent this issue and as like... people?

       [In the most recent screen shot i put turky not turkey]

Also adding lights along a hallway that direct away from gunshots so its not mass confusion, with a side of mass murderer. 

This seems stupid I know, but its a good start towards something better.
